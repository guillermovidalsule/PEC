# Tasks
These folder contains the additional tasks that were proposed by our teacher. 
The aim of these tasks was to learn the whole process of designing a PCB before doing it ourselves.
Please note that this folder was included to show our learning progress and document our work.

### Folders & Files
1. **Introduction** : Presentation of our first idea on how to direct the project.
2. **Breadboard** : We learnt the basics of CAD and circuit designing on a breadboard.
3. **Prototyping Board** : Soldering the previous circuit and adding a simple extra functionality.
