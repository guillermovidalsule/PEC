# Introduction
By using a template we were ordered to make a schematic of a cirucuit and build it onto a protoboard.    
The aim of this task was to start familiarizing ourselves with Fusion 360 and circuit designing.

### Files
+ **schematic.png** : Picture of the schematic
+ **protoboard_demonstrationg.mp4** : Video showing the circuit working.

### Notes
We made a slight different version of the circuit because of personal preference, but fundamentally it is still the same.
