# Solder
This stage focused on mastering our soldering skills, so we endeavoured on practicing by using some soldering practice tools.

### Files
+ **report.pdf** : Report of this phase.
+ **circle_board.MOV** : Video that illustrates that the LEDs are working as intended.

### Notes
The LED circle board was soldered individually, so the video displays the board soldered by the author of this repository.
